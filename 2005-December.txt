Subject: [Wescamp-i18n-announce] Delfador's Memoirs is alive again!
Message-ID: <200512081846.36572.tapik@buchtovi.cz>

Hi All Delfador fans! 
I'm glad to announce that the Delfador's Memoirs campaign has changed its 
maintainer (me :-) ) and that the new, fully internationalized, revision 
0.6.0 is ready and waiting for your downloads on the campaign server.

Plenty of thanks to Torangan for his help with wescamp. His patience with me 
and my stupid questions and my mistakes let me change this campaign to the 
playable and translatable version.

Please, inform me about all bugs you will find. I'm sure there are some bugs 
there, I'm a very green greenhorn in the wesnoth development.

Current and all new translators, the campaign is waiting for you!
